# Acacia Reads ðŸ“š

Acacia Reads is a **GraphQL API** for a fictional online bookstore.  
It manages **books, authors, customers, and orders**.  

I created this repository as a **GraphQL coding challenge** to practice my skills in schema design, query/mutation implementation, and API best practices.
